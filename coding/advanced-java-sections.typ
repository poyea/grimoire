= Advanced Java

*Comprehensive coverage of Java from fundamentals to high-performance concurrent systems. Designed for senior developer interviews at low-latency, high-throughput companies.*

*See also:* Arrays, Dynamic Programming (for general algorithmic patterns)

== Overview

This section covers both foundational and advanced Java concepts critical for senior Java developer roles, particularly in:
- High-frequency trading systems
- Low-latency financial applications
- High-throughput transaction processing
- Real-time risk management systems

*Key focus areas:*
- JVM internals & memory model
- Concurrency & thread safety
- Lock-free programming & CAS
- GC tuning & latency optimization
- Modern Java features (8-21)

*Prerequisites:* Basic Java syntax, understanding of OOP concepts

== Interview Strategy

*Common interview patterns for senior Java roles:*

*Coding rounds:*
- Implement thread-safe data structures
- Fix concurrency bugs
- Optimize for low latency/high throughput
- Design concurrent systems

*System design rounds:*
- Order matching engine
- Real-time pricing system
- Market data feed handler
- High-frequency trading platform

*Behavioral:*
- Production incidents with concurrency issues
- Performance optimization war stories
- GC tuning experiences
